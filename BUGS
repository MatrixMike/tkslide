Known bugs:

- cannot start with eTcl 1 rc 23

- not exactly a bug -- it doesn't work with 16bit SNOBOLs from Catspaw, Inc. 

- syntax highlighting needs some significant reworking.

- there's no 'maximize' button under KDE 3.2.x w/TCL 8.4.4.
  Fix: update TCL to 8.4.7+
  Workaround: Resize manually 

- my English. After 8 years in Germany my German is still wanting some
  improvement, but it didn't stop my English from getting even worse. (I'm not
  even sure if the previous sentence was in English).

- interactive (using keyboard entry) programs may hang the IDE

- to stop program which entered endless loop one has to kill the snobol4
	process.
